## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Figma
- Lots and lots of little tweaks that were probably overkill

### What I learned

I had just finished the mobile layout and was ready to tackle the desktop layout when I caught a nasty flu. I was out of commission for a week and a half and it was very difficult to get back into this project and finish it! I was really glad I had used a lot of comments in my code so I could re-aquaint myself with what was going on.

### Continued development

I'd like to work more with grid as it seems very powerful and I'm just scratching the surface of what it can do.

## Acknowledgments

Kevin Powell did a video on this project and it was a useful reference. I built the full mobile layout first and then referenced his video to understand how grid could be use to layout the desktop version. I was proud of being able to understand the concepts and then apply them to my own project without directly copying his approach.
